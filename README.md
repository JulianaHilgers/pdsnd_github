### Introduction
Hi there, my name is Juliana and this is the first time I got in contact with coding **at all**. I am super excited to have gotten so far. 

### Project Title and Date
The project I am working on is called _Bikeshare Project_ and was created on 02/08/2024.

### Description
In this project, we will analyze bike-sharing data to understand how users interact with the bike-sharing system. The dataset includes information about bike trips, such as start and end times, trip duration, user types, and the locations of bike stations.
The objectives of the project are:
* **Data Exploration**
* **Data Visualization**
* **Statistical Analysis** and
* **Insights and Recommendations**

### Files used
The files used included csv files from 3 different cities: _Chicago_, _New York City_ and _Washington_.

### Credits
As I have mentioned this was my very **first project**. Without the [Udacity Team](https://www.udacity.com) I would have never completed this task.
